ECG Trace Creation
==================

The set of scripts contained within this repository are designed to create an ECG trace that could potentially be recorded from an 8x8 grid of electrodes placed on the left ventricle of the heart.

Distribution
============

This software uses setuptools_scm to determine the package version number.  In short this uses git tags
to determine the version of the package.  As an example to set the version for this package a git tag must
be made with the version number as the tag name.  This can be achieved like so::

 git tag -a v0.1.4 -m "Version 0.1.4"
